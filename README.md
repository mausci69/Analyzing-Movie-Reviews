# Analyzing-Movie-Reviews

In this project we'll analyze a short dataset containing 146 movies and their rates from 4 among the major review services:
  Metacritic,
  Fandango,
  Rotten Tomatoes,
  IMDB
Watching the data, it's easy to see how the rates from Fandango are significantly higher than the other three.
We put the Fandango and the Metacritic rates together to perform some analysis to try to understand something more.
